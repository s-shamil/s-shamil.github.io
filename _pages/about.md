Hi, I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a>, National University of Singapore. I am working with Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/">Angela Yao</a> in the <a href="https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/">CVML@NUS</a> lab. My current research focus is utilizing hand-pose data for action recognition and video understanding. 

I completed my Bachelor of Science from <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Department of CSE</a>, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in February 2021. I worked with Professor <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">M. Sohel Rahman</a> for my thesis in computer vision for medical images. We also worked on agent-based modeling and string algorithms. After my graduation, I served as a lecturer at the department of Computer Science and Engineering, United International University, Dhaka before starting my PhD.

Hi, I am a Lecturer at the Dept. of ECE, <a href="https://ece.northsouth.edu/">North South University (NSU)</a>, Dhaka. I graduated with a <b>Master of Science</b> (Research) from School of Computing, <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a> in 2025. During my time at NUS, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/">Angela Yao</a> in the <a href="https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/">CVML@NUS</a> lab, focusing on the utilization of 3D hand poses for multimodal action recognition. Previously, I completed my <b>Bachelor of Science</b> from the Dept. of CSE, <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a> in 2021, where I worked with Prof. <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">M. Sohel Rahman</a> on computer vision for medical images. We also worked on agent-based modeling for infectious diseases. Before joining NSU, I was a Lecturer in the Dept. of CSE, <a href="https://cse.uiu.ac.bd/">United International University (UIU)</a> from February 2021, with a study leave for my master’s.

I am broadly interested in computer vision research, including 3D video understanding and healthcare applications.

Hi, I am a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a>, National University of Singapore and a lecturer (on study leave) at <a href="https://cse.uiu.ac.bd/">United International University, Dhaka</a>. I am working with Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/">Angela Yao</a> in the <a href="https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/">CVML@NUS</a> lab. My current research focus is utilizing hand pose data for action recognition and video understanding. 

I completed my Bachelor of Science from the <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Department of CSE</a>, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in February 2021. As part of my undergrad thesis, I worked with Professor <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">M. Sohel Rahman</a> on computer vision for medical images. We also worked on agent-based modeling for infectious diseases. After graduating, I served as a lecturer at the Computer Science and Engineering department, United International University, Dhaka.

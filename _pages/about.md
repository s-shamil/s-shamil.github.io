Hi, I am a first-year CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a>, National University of Singapore. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in February 2021. After that, I served as a lecturer at the department of Computer Science and Engineering, United International University, Dhaka before starting my PhD.

I have an immense interest in exploring and working on exciting research areas of modern computer science. My research experience includes application of deep learning in the fields of computer vision and bioinformatics, agent-based modeling for infectious disease and analyzing abelian borders of strings. I am also interested in the theory and applications of graph neural networks and development of interpretable machine learning.

During my undergrad, I started to work with Professor <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">M. Sohel Rahman</a>. I express my gratitude to him for introducing me to research and also for supervising my thesis work.

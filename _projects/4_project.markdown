This project was done as a part of the coursework under the course CSE108: Object Oriented Programming Language Sessional. This application takes an URL as input and starts downloading the contents on that URL. Download path to put the contents can also be selected. User can add and run multiple downloads at the same time and manage them individually or collectively. For example, we can add pause/resume/remove any active download process. User can close the program without losing any progress. The application provides some useful statistics for each download too, e.g., file size, visual progress bar, download speed and estimated time left.

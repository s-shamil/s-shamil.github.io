title: DoS Attack to DNS Server Using Spoofed IP address
description: A project as part of Computer Security coursework - using C++, Python as programming languages and setting up ”Simple DNS Plus” as the DNS server.

In this project, a DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack was demonstrated on a DNS server using spoofed IP address.

The main objective of this project was performing DoS-attack by implementing a program to send out DNS queries which contain spoofed IP addresses. This would overwhelm the DNS server and it would have a hard time filtering these attacks as the spoofed IP addresses could be any random IP address. Since DNS servers use UDP traffic for name resolution, sending a massive number of DNS requests to a DNS server can consume its resources, resulting in a significantly slower response time for legitimate DNS requests. Eventually, the server becomes overloaded to the point that it is no longer functioning normally.
